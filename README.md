## Introduction

Welcome to the Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) project, with a specific focus on Bengali license plates. This repository contains the code and dataset used in our research. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive solution for accurately and efficiently recognizing Bengali license plates, even under challenging conditions such as poor lighting, diverse plate fonts, and variations in sizes and orientations.

## Abstract

Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) is a system that automatically reads and extracts data from vehicle license plates using image processing and computer vision techniques. The goal of ALPR is to identify and read license plate numbers accurately and quickly. Our proposed method includes image restoration, maximizing contrast, morphological image processing, feature extraction, and character segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We have prepared a dataset of 1292 images of Bengali digits and characters. Our system demonstrates an impressive 88% accuracy rate for license plate recognition, even with poor-quality images.

## Features

- Accurate and efficient Bengali license plate recognition.
- Robust performance under challenging conditions.
- Deep learning and image processing techniques.
- GFPGAN image enhancement and ResNet-50 model utilization.
- A dataset of 1292 Bengali license plate images.
